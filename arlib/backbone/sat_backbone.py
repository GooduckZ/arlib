Algorithms for computing backbones of SAT formulas

This module provides several algorithms for computing backbones of SAT formulas:

1. Iterative Algorithm: The most straightforward approach that tests each 
   variable one by one using a SAT solver.

2. Chunking Algorithm: Improves efficiency by testing multiple variables 
   at once in "chunks".

3. Backbone Refinement Algorithm: Uses a refinement-based approach that
   leverages previous models to quickly identify backbone literals.
