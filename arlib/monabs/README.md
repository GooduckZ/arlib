# Monadic Predicate Abstraction

## Overview

Given a formula and a set of predicates {P1,...,Pn},
decide for each Pi, whether F and Pi is satisfiable or not.

## Applications

- k-induction (in checking mulitple properties)
- Optimization Modulo Theories (for symbolic abstraction)
- Value-flow analysis (in checking mulitple properties)
- etc.? (e.g., as a sub-proceure of other algorithms)
