# Model Counting

Model counting is the problem of determining the number of possible solutions (models) to a given formula. It is a fundamental problem in computer science and has applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence, cryptography, and verification.

## Model Counting for SAT Formulas

To count models for SAT formulas, please use `sharpSAT` or other third-party tools.

## Model Counting for QF_BV Formulas

QF_BV stands for quantifier-free bit-vector logic. It is a subset of the SMT-LIB standard and is commonly used in the analysis and verification of computer hardware and software systems. 

To count the models of a QF_BF formula, refer to `arlib\bv\qfbv_counting.py`.
