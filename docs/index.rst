Introduction
=============

Arlib is a toolkit for playing with various automated reasoning tasks.  Some of its key features include:

* Solving exits-forall SMT formulas
* Solving general quantified SMT formulas
* Quantifier elimination
* Sampling solutions of SMT formulas
* Counting the models of SMT formulas
* Optimization Modulo Theory (OMT) solving
* Interpolant generation
* Minimal satisfying assignment
* Symbolic abstraction
* Abductive inference
* Knowledge compilation
* MaxSAT, MaxSMT, and OMT
* QBF solving
* Formula rewritings/simplifications
* ...

We welcome any feedback, issues, or suggestions for improvement. Please feel free to open an issue in our repository.
