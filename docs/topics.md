Here is an optimized version of the code:

# Summer Research, Honours/Master Thesis Project Topics

## Parallel/Distributed Bit-Vector Optimizations

Refer to `arlib/bv/bvopt.py` for single-objective and multi-objectives optimization.

Note that in some algorithms, we may reduce a single-objective optimization problem to a special multi-objectives optimization problem (e.g., "Bit-vector optimization, TACAS'16").

## Bit-Vector Interpolation

Refer to `arlib/bv/bvipt.py`.

## Bit-Vector Model Counting

Refer to `arlib/bv/bv_counting`.
