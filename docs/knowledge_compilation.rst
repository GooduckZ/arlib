Introduction to Knowledge Compilation
=======

Knowledge compilation is a technique in artificial intelligence 
that aims to preprocess a knowledge base or a set of constraints
into a more efficient and compact representation that can be used for 
faster reasoning. The idea is to transform the
original representation of the knowledge base into a form 
that is easier to manipulate and reason about, , often involving techniques like decision diagrams.
The compiled representation enables more efficient query answering or problem-solving than the original form.


OBDD
------

OBDD stands for Ordered Binary Decision Diagram. It's a compact data structure used in computer science and artificial intelligence to represent Boolean functions. An OBDD is a directed acyclic graph where each node represents a Boolean variable with two outgoing edges labeled 0 and 1, indicating the variable being false or true, respectively. The nodes are ordered according to a fixed variable ordering, ensuring that equivalent OBDDs are identical.
