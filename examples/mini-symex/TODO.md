# TODO for a Full-Featured Python Concolic Executor

## Modelling Language Features
- Comprehensive `with` statement and context manager support
- Complete generator and iterator support
- Enhanced decorator and metaprogramming capabilities
- Native method invocation support
- Dynamic typing and type coercion
- Improved variable scoping in nested functions and closures
- Better support for lambda functions and functional programming
- Enhanced list/dict/set comprehensions
- Advanced exception handling (finally blocks, try-with-resources)
- Metaclass support
- Annotations and type hints integration
- Await/async/coroutine support
- Dataclass support
- Property and descriptor protocol

## Path Exploration Strategies
- Advanced path prioritization heuristics
- Directed symbolic execution
- Fuzzing integration (hybrid concolic execution)
- State merging to address path explosion
- Intelligent backtracking
- Incremental exploration for large codebases
- Checkpoint and resume capabilities

## Memory Management
- Memory usage optimization for large programs
- Garbage collection awareness
- Symbolic memory modeling
- Detection of memory-related issues
