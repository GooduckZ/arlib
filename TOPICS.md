# A few Topics for Summer Research, Honours/Master Thesis Projects


## Parallel/Distributed Bit-Vector Optimizations

See `pdsmt/bv/bvopt.py`

- Single-objective optimization
- Multi-objectives optimization

Note that in some algorithms, we may "reduce" a single-objective optimization problem
to a special multi-objectives optimization problem (e.g., "Bit-vector optimization, TACAS'16").


## Bit-Vector Interpolation

See `pdsmt/bv/bvipt.py`


## Bit-Vector Model Counting

See `pdsmt/bv/bvcounting`

## Parallel/Distributed CDCL(T) SMT Solving

See `pdsmt/cdcl/parallel/cdclt.py`


## Exists-Forall over Linear Integer/Real
