# TODO LIST

## Research 

There are many interesting research topics. You are welcome to contribute to the following research topics:

- Parallel CDCL(T): See `arlib/smt/pcdclt`
- SMT for finite field: See  `arlib/smt/ff`


## Interfaces

- Python API
- CLI tools

## Features

### Quadratic Programming

- https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers

### Projection

 - Fourier-Motzkin elimination
 - Simplex method
  
### Advanced Profiling

- https://github.com/viperproject/smt-scope: A tool for visualising, analysing and understanding quantifier instantiations made via E-matching in a run of an SMT solver 

## Documentation

See  `arlib/docs`

## Applications
You are welcome to contribute to the following applications:

### General

- `Testing`: CIT, symbolic execution, translation validation
- `Static Bug Finding`: value-flow analysis, path-sensitive data-flow analysis
- `Verification`: K-induction, BMC, temlate-based verification, symbolic abstraction
- `Synthesis`: enumerative, deductive
- `Optimization`: superoptimization, polyhedral compilation

### Domaina Specific

- `Dobfuscation`,
- `Cryptanalysis`, e.g., https://github.com/ranea/CASCADA, https://github.com/kste/cryptosmt, https://github.com/hadipourh/zero
- `ML/LLM`: kernal fusion
